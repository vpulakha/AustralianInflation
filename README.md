Australian Inflation Index of Consumer Prices 

The September 2022 quarterly inflation figures were released by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the numbers were the highest in over 33 years 
(https://www.rba.gov.au/inflation/inflation-target.html).  The inflation rate was 7.3% for the quarter. You have to go all the way back to 1987 
to find similar numbers.  The problem with a single headline number is that it does not give you a sense of what category of products and servies 
are more expensive now (2022) compared to a historical period, say over the last decade.  Fourtunately, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 
compiles a very detailed list of consumer prices and it is fascinating to see how prices have changed over time.  

Below are a series of animated charts of the food price index since 2012:
